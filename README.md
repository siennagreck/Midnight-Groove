# Midnight-Groove
Author: Sienna Greck
Course: Working with Data and Code 
Platform: TunePad
Language : Python


Midnight Groove is a three-minute hybrid Jazz-pop composition coded in Python using the TunePad platform. It demonstrates rhythmic layering, harmonic sequencing, and algorithmic modulation through iterative loops and conditional functions. 
This prototype merges musical composition and computational creativity, showcasing my development in code literacy - specifically how data structures (lists, dictionaries) and algorithmic control (loops, variables, conditional logic) can simulate expressive musical phrasing.
Learning Objectives:
This project was created to:
* demonstrate proficiency in Python-based sound synthesis on TunePad.
* Apply data and code literacy to music production and pattern generation.
* Integrate core programming concepts: variables, functions, operators, conditionals, lists, and loops.
* Explore aesthetic translation - transforming code logic into rhythm, harmony, and melody.
**Key Insights and Development**
Throughout the project:
* I learned how algorithmic repetition can generate harmonic predictability while enabling creative improvisation.
* I gained understanding of how data types (integers, strings, lists) influence musical attributes (pitch, rhythm, dynamics).
* By adjusting loops and velocity decay, I could simulate emotional transitions - such as a crescendo or fade out - through code.
* Debugging became part of the creative process, reinforcing computational problem-solving as a form of musical iteration.

SETUP & USAGE 
1. Open TunePad
2. Import the file (tunepad_project_117898.json)
3. Click Run All Cells to play the full composition
4. Adjust volume sliders for balance (bass ≈ 70%, piano ≈ 80%).
5. Optionally remix: modify chord progressions or adjust BPM
