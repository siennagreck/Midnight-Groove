# Midnight-Groove
Midnight Groove is a three-minute Jazz-Pop fusion created in TunePad using Python. It blends pop’s rhythmic drive with jazz’s harmonic depth, generating synchronized bass, guitar, piano, and chorus layers over 360 beats at 120 BPM—all produced through code, not pre-recorded sound.
